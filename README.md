# Fairness and Bias in the Facebook News Feed

This repository contains the dataset and R codes needed to analyse the bias of the Facebook News Feed Algorithm. The 2018 General Italian Elections experiment served as a case study. Later, we propose fair methods to design timelines.

If you use the dataset, please cite our complete work that will appear in the 36th International Symposium on Computer Performance, 
Modeling, Measurements and Evaluation 2018.
